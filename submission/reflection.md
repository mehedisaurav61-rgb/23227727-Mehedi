# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? How did they help?
I only used ChatGpt for this assignment as a supporting tool. It helped me to elaborate the programming concept alongside with creating example of Python functions. Moreover, I also got the guidance here of handling the weather data and visualisations. It also helped me in Debugging errors, creating better code structure and clarifications on integrating various elements. Data retrieval, parsing and graph creation were some of the components. However, it increased my knowledge of understanding in completing this project. 
## Prompting Techniques
Which intentional prompting strategies did you apply?
I applied procedural prompting strategy for getting the tasks completed. I have provided ChatGpt step by step instructions so that it completes each and every task accordingly. For instance, I asked out how each functions should be working and after that create the needed Python code. Thus, it helped through debugging and visualising the output. I tried to break all the problems into smaller stages for getting the project develop in a correct way with proper instructions.

# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? How did they help?
I only used ChatGpt for this assignment as a supporting tool. It helped me to elaborate the programming concept alongside with creating example of Python functions. Moreover, I also got the guidance here of handling the weather data and visualisations. It also helped me in Debugging errors, creating better code structure and clarifications on integrating various elements. Data retrieval, parsing and graph creation were some of the components. However, it increased my knowledge of understanding in completing this project. 
## Prompting Techniques
Which intentional prompting strategies did you apply?
I applied procedural prompting strategy for getting the tasks completed. I have provided ChatGpt step by step instructions so that it completes each and every task accordingly. For instance, I asked out how each functions should be working and after that create the needed Python code. Thus, it helped through debugging and visualising the output. I tried to break all the problems into smaller stages for getting the project develop in a correct way with proper instructions. 
## What Worked Well?
Describe one thing you’re proud of.
If I am proud of something about this project that would be the merging the weather data retrieval with the feature of visualisations. From wttr.in API, I found the real time data which helped me in the project. Through python graphs, I was capable to portray the temperature and precipitaion trends distinctly. This enhanced my ability to gather the data and analysis correctly which also helped me to illustrate the visual presentation. 
## What Would You Do Differently?
Describe one thing you'd change if you had more time.
If I had more time I would have intereact with the AI in a better way. For instance, I would have increased more conversations with the weather parsing function. It would have given me visualisations in detail widely. I could have more informations about the wind speed graphs which would make the system more accurate. 
## Final Thoughts
Any parting comments on your learning experience?
It has been a great learning experience for me. It enhanced my knowledge of understanding in data analysis. Though I had to face some problems while doing this project such as getting data from API and not able to fetch real data for more than 3 days. For getting the much needed data, I had several conversations with ChatGpt to have the data I wanted.

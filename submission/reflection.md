# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? How did they help?
I only used ChatGpt for this assignment as a supporting tool. It helped me to elaborate the programming concept alongside with creating example of Python functions. Moreover, I also got the guidance here of handling the weather data and visualisations. It also helped me in Debugging errors, creating better code structure and clarifications on integrating various elements. However, it increased my knowledge of understanding in completing this project.

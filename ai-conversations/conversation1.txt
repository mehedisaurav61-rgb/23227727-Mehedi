me: how to use the wttr.in api
ai: Using the wttr.in API is very straightforward because it’s a free, no-authentication-needed weather API. You can get weather in JSON, text, or image formats directly from HTTP requests. Here’s a complete guide on how to use it:

1. Base URL
https://wttr.in/<location>


<location> can be a city, region, or country.

Examples:

https://wttr.in/London

https://wttr.in/New+York

https://wttr.in/Bangladesh

2. Formats
a) Plain Text
https://wttr.in/London


Returns a terminal-style weather display.

b) JSON Format
https://wttr.in/London?format=j1


Returns structured JSON with:

current_condition: Current weather

weather: Forecasts (today, tomorrow, etc.)

nearest_area: Location info

request: Your query info

Example usage in Python:

import requests

url = "https://wttr.in/London?format=j1"
response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()

print(data["current_condition"][0]["temp_C"])  # Current temperature in °C
print(data["weather"][0]["avgtempC"])         # Today's average temp

c) Custom Text Format
https://wttr.in/London?format=%t+%p


%t → Temperature

%p → Precipitation

Example response: 15°C 0.0mm

You can combine these for custom outputs:

%l → Location

%c → Condition

%h → Humidity

%w → Wind

Reference: wttr.in format codes

d) Weather Images
https://wttr.in/London.png


Returns a PNG image of the weather forecast.

3. Example: Python function to get JSON weather
import requests

def get_weather(location):
    url = f"https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j1"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    return data

weather = get_weather("Perth")
print(weather["current_condition"][0]["temp_C"])

4. Notes

No API key required.

You can limit results to 1–5 forecast days.

Hourly forecast is available in the "hourly" field for each day.

Can be used in scripts, notebooks, or command-line tools.

me: what is the return type
ai: When you query wttr.in, the return type depends on the URL format you request:

1. Plain Text
https://wttr.in/London


Return type: str (ASCII-art text of the weather)

Example snippet:

Weather report: London

      \   /     Partly cloudy
       .-.      
    ― (   ) ―   
       `-’      
      /   \     

2. JSON
https://wttr.in/London?format=j1


Return type: dict (Python dictionary after using .json())

Structure:

{
  "current_condition": [
    {
      "temp_C": "15",
      "weatherDesc": [{"value": "Partly cloudy"}],
      "windspeedKmph": "12",
      "precipMM": "0.0",
      ...
    }
  ],
  "weather": [
    {
      "date": "2025-10-17",
      "maxtempC": "18",
      "mintempC": "10",
      "avgtempC": "14",
      "hourly": [
        {
          "time": "0",
          "tempC": "12",
          "precipMM": "0.0",
          ...
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ],
  "nearest_area": [...],
  "request": [...]
}


Access in Python:

data = response.json()
current_temp = data["current_condition"][0]["temp_C"]  # string
today_avg_temp = data["weather"][0]["avgtempC"]        # string

3. Custom One-line Text
https://wttr.in/London?format=%t+%p


Return type: str

Example: "15°C 0.0mm"

4. Image
https://wttr.in/London.png


Return type: binary image data (you can save it as .png)

In Python:

response = requests.get("https://wttr.in/London.png")
with open("weather.png", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)


✅ Summary:

me: what is needed for preceipitation data
ai: To get precipitation data from the wttr.in API, you need to focus on the following fields in the JSON (?format=j1) response:

1. Current precipitation
current_precip = data["current_condition"][0]["precipMM"]  # in mm


"precipMM" gives the amount of precipitation (rain/snow) in millimeters for the current period.

2. Forecast precipitation

The forecast is under data["weather"], which is a list of daily forecasts.
Each day contains:

"maxtempC", "mintempC", "avgtempC" – temperatures (optional for context)

"hourly" – list of hourly forecast data

Each hourly entry has:

hourly_data["precipMM"]  # precipitation in mm
hourly_data["time"]      # time in 24h format (e.g., "0", "300", "600", ..., "2100")


Example: sum daily precipitation

day = data["weather"][0]  # today
total_precip_mm = sum(float(hour["precipMM"]) for hour in day["hourly"])

3. Optional additional info

"weatherDesc" – description like "Light rain", "Sunny", etc.

"chanceofrain" – in some APIs or hourly entries

"chanceofsnow" – same

Summary of required fields

For precipitation visualization, you typically need:

Date → day["date"]

Hourly precipitation → hour["precipMM"]

(Optional) Weather description → hour["weatherDesc"][0]["value"]

me: what is needed for temperature data
ai: For temperature data from the wttr.in API, you mainly look at both the daily summary and hourly details in the JSON response (?format=j1). Here's what you need:

1. Current temperature
current_temp = data["current_condition"][0]["temp_C"]  # in Celsius
current_temp_F = data["current_condition"][0]["temp_F"]  # in Fahrenheit

2. Forecast temperature (daily)

The forecast is under data["weather"], a list of daily forecasts. Each day contains:

"maxtempC" → Maximum temperature for the day (°C)

"mintempC" → Minimum temperature for the day (°C)

"avgtempC" → Average temperature for the day (°C)

Example:

today = data["weather"][0]
max_temp = today["maxtempC"]
min_temp = today["mintempC"]
avg_temp = today["avgtempC"]

3. Hourly temperature (more detailed)

Each day has an "hourly" list with 8 time slots (0, 300, 600… up to 2100). Each hourly entry contains:

hour["tempC"]       # Temperature in Celsius
hour["tempF"]       # Temperature in Fahrenheit
hour["FeelsLikeC"]  # Feels like temperature
hour["FeelsLikeF"]


You can use this if you want an hourly temperature plot instead of just daily max/min/avg.

Summary of required fields for visualization

Dates → day["date"]

Daily temperature → day["maxtempC"], day["mintempC"], day["avgtempC"]

Hourly temperature (optional) → hour["tempC"]

me: how to oriente the return of get_weather_data response
ai: Ah, now I understand — you want to structure or “orient” the JSON response from get_weather_data() so it’s easier to use for plotting precipitation or temperature. Here’s a detailed explanation and example.

1. Basic structure returned by get_weather_data()

If you call:

weather_data = get_weather_data("Perth")


You get a dictionary roughly like this:

{
  "location": "Perth",
  "current_condition": [
    {
      "temp_C": "25",
      "temp_F": "77",
      "weatherDesc": [{"value": "Sunny"}],
      "precipMM": "0.0",
      ...
    }
  ],
  "forecast": [
    {
      "date": "2025-10-17",
      "maxtempC": "28",
      "mintempC": "16",
      "avgtempC": "22",
      "hourly": [
        {"time": "0", "tempC": "18", "precipMM": "0.0", ...},
        {"time": "300", "tempC": "17", "precipMM": "0.0", ...},
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ],
  "raw_data": { ... }  # full JSON returned from wttr.in
}

2. How to “orient” the data

For precipitation or temperature visualization, you usually want a list of dates and a list of corresponding values.

Example: Daily precipitation
dates = []
total_precip = []

for day in weather_data["forecast"]:
    dates.append(day["date"])
    daily_precip = sum(float(h["precipMM"]) for h in day["hourly"])
    total_precip.append(daily_precip)


dates → x-axis of your chart

total_precip → y-axis

Example: Daily temperature
dates = []
max_temps = []
min_temps = []
avg_temps = []

for day in weather_data["forecast"]:
    dates.append(day["date"])
    max_temps.append(float(day["maxtempC"]))
    min_temps.append(float(day["mintempC"]))
    avg_temps.append(float(day["avgtempC"]))


dates → x-axis

max_temps, min_temps, avg_temps → y-axis series for plotting

3. Optional: Hourly orientation

If you want hourly temperature or precipitation plots, you can flatten the hours:

hours = []
hourly_precip = []

for day in weather_data["forecast"]:
    for hour in day["hourly"]:
        time_str = f"{day['date']} {int(hour['time'])//100:02d}:00"
        hours.append(time_str)
        hourly_precip.append(float(hour["precipMM"]))


Now hours is x-axis with timestamps, hourly_precip is y-axis.

✅ Key idea:
get_weather_data() already organizes the JSON by current_condition and forecast. To “orient” it for visualization, you just extract and flatten the data you need into lists for dates/times and values.
